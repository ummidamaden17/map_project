Interns are invited to develop a mini-service within the NomadGo ecosystem, enabling users to seamlessly order taxis through a mobile application. This project will provide hands-on experience in building a real-world service while collaborating in a structured team environment. Each participant—designer, backend developer, and mobile developer—will focus on their specialized role, ensuring smooth integration of all components. The designer will craft an intuitive and visually appealing UI, while the backend developer will build the service infrastructure. The mobile developer will bring the app to life, ensuring seamless functionality and user experience. Throughout the internship, participants will engage in team coordination, agile workflows, and technical problem-solving. This is a unique opportunity to gain valuable industry experience while contributing to an exciting and impactful project.
